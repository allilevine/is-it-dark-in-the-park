# Is it dark in the park? (10K Apart Entry)

My project leverages Google Maps data and PHP's sunrise and sunset functions to determine if it's dark in the park (or any place) the user enters. It's important to know whether a park is dark not only for safety reasons, but also for successful nighttime star gazing. There's an added visual effect to indicate darkness in CSS-enabled browsers.
